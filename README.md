## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Cloud Security Engineer focused on securing cloud-native systems on AWS through automation, strong identity controls, and security-by-design principles. I work on building scalable and resilient cloud architectures with integrated security, monitoring, and compliance controls.

I’m particularly interested in how AI and automation can enhance cloud security operations — such as improving detection, reducing misconfigurations, and strengthening API and workload protection — while keeping human decision-making at the core.

🔐 Currently working on: AWS cloud security architecture, DevSecOps pipelines, infrastructure-as-code security, and automated security controls  
🤖 Learning: AI/ML concepts for cybersecurity, threat detection techniques, zero-trust architectures  
💬 Ask me about: AWS IAM, cloud networking security, DevSecOps security, Terraform, monitoring & incident response  
🤝 Open to: Collaboration, freelance projects, and cloud / platform security roles
